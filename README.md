# The Habit Book
24 Hour Code Challenge: Making an application to track daily habits throughout the new year. To be used in place of my Daily Checklists.

## Motivation
To this day, I use a notebook to record all of my daily checklist items and habits that I want to be doing to improve myself. The problem is, paper and a notebook doesn't give me aggregate metrics for things that I do repeatedly. Additionally, I would like to see my behavioral patterns improve or worsen over time in a better format. So, I'm challenging myself to create an online habit tracker for myself (and others) to use for 2021, before 2021. I am starting this project on Wednesday the 30th, and hope to have a fully functioning web app complete by the end of the day tomorrow!

## Tech Stack
Choosing to move forward with a React frontend and a Django backend connected to a cloud hosted postgres server.

## Dev Log
I plan on keeping a development log of this project. More details to follow.
